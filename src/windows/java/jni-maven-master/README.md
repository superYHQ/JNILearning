jni-maven
=========

jni-maven is a sample project intended to be used as a template for Java applications using JNI.

Requirements
------------

You'll need the following:
- JDK
- gcc
- maven
- ant
- make

Usage
-----

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gkubisa/jni-maven.git jni-maven
cd jni-maven
mvn package
java -cp target/jni-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ie.agisoft.App
```

How it works
------------

[maven-antrun-plugin][] is added to the *process-classes* phase of the build. It is used to:

- generate the C++ headers using *javah*. They are created in src/main/c++. 
  I did not use *javah* ant target, because it assumes Sun JDK, while I'm using OpenJDK.
- run *make* to build the native code

The Makefile compiles the native code from src/main/c++ into \*.o files which are stored in target/c++. 
Then it runs the linker which produces a single \*.so object stored in *target/classes*.

Because the \*.so file is in *target/classes*, it's included in the final JAR file. This way the
whole project produces a single artifact and can be easily used as a dependency by other Maven projects.

The final bit is the custom module loader *LibraryLoader.loadLibrary*, which extracts the 
native library from the jar into a temporary file and loads it - the standard *System.loadLibrary* cannot do it.

Limitations / possible improvements
-----------------------------------

1. Native code build currently works only on Linux
2. Only C++ is supported as the native language
3. The paths in the Makefile are hard-coded. It would be nice to initialize them from Maven properties.

**Patches welcome!**
